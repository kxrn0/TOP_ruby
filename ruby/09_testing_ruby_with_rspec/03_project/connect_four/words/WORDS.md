GAME OVER!
「x」 wins!
```

All winning combinations will be highlighted.

If the board fills up before there's a winner, the message indicates so

```
GAME OVER!
it's a tie!
```

After the game is over the players are asked if they want to play again.

```
play again (y / n) >
```

If they choose `y`, everything is reset.

### UHP

There are three places the user enters something

- who goes first
- column number
- play again

#### who goes first

If the user enters anything other than 1 or 2, we show them an error message.

```
Who should go first?

(1) - x
(2) - o

> me

Please enter '1' or '2'!

> you

Please enter '1' or '2'!

>
```

#### column number

It has to be a valid column number or `exit`, and the column has to not be full.

```
