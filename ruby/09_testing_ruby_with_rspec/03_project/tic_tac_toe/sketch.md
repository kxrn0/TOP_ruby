## Description
The game is meant to be played by two humans. When the the program is first started, the computer will ask the users for an unique character marker for each one. It then will ask who's turn will be first. Once the identities and turn order is set up, the game object will start the game loop. We first check if the board is full, if it is, we end the current game, and ask the users if they want to play again. If they do so, they'll go through what they went at the beggining. If the board is not full, we ask the current user to select a cell until they select a valid one. Once the user selects a valid cell, we print the board, and check if the user has won. If so, we print a message indicating this, end the current game, and ask the users if they want to play again. If the user didn't win, we run the game loop again.
