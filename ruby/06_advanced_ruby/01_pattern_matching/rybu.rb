  1.- What is pattern matching?

  Pattern matching is using patterns to match the structure of objects without having to resort to long chains of if/else statements
=end

=begin
  2.- What is the difference between array patterns and hash patterns?

  In array patterns the number of elements in the tested array has to be the same and the elements have to be the same type as in the pattern, while in the hash pattern it will match if only a subset of the fields of the hash satisfies the pattern.

=begin
  3.- What is the variable pattern match?

  A pattern that binds the match to a variable.
=end

=begin
  4.- What are the different ways of pattern matching on an array?

  With literal values, the classes of the expected elements, the splay operator, and combinations of those.

=begin
  Explain the find pattern.

  It's an array pattern that uses splat operators on either side of the pattern that we want to match. We can assign names to end points to set their values to variables.
