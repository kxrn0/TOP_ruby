# Knights Travails

The board is a graph, the squares are the vertices, and the moves are the edges. The graph is undirected, since if you can go from square A to B, you can use that same edge to go from B to A.

The instructions warn that an algoritm could lead to an infinite loop. Given that the graph is undirected I can kind of see both algorithms leading to that, but I'll have to think harder about this.
